# 5 December 2025
1- migrate all config to yaml file instead of flags
2- make multiple authentication method
    - shared key
    - username, password in static (db)
    - username, password using ldap
    - trust only based on client Tls certificate (actually no auth)

3- TLS is expensive protect it from attackers and tls harding

4- dockerize project
5- create full setup readme
6- make rbac rules which CN or cn, org or can access route by ip address and sni and make routing policy
7- anomaly detection like bruteforce, Distributed Denied Of Service (ddos) (Flood tunnel port with TCP packets, send malformed packets to crash your service),
 credential stuffing, dictionary attacks, Send malformed packets, Attempt buffer overflow, Crash/generate panic in Go code, Trigger goroutine leaks or memory exhaustion,
  Stolen client certificates, Compromised private keys, Expired/forged certificates if CA validation is weak (Attacker impersonates legitimate client inside the zero-trust context.)
  and integration with Firewall iptables, nf_tables, Mikrotik, Pfsense, OpnSense, F5, ...
8- (run ip transit mode, instead of point to point (in ip transit mode its like a VPN (layer 3)))
